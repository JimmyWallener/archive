# OpenChat
 Chat client with firebase auth - School Project

The assignment is to create an open chat client with sign-in/new account registration.
App must be connected and utilize firebase database.
Assignment also requires the usage of milestones for sprints.

Basic idea is to create a simple start activity gives two selections - Sign-In or Register new account.
Sign-in is based on email and not username, but username will be used as handle in chatwindow.

Register new account will only take three inputs: Email,Username, Password. While creating a new account, a verification email will be sent out with link for user to click. This will ensure valid emails connected to app.

Chatfunction will be basic, since it will most probably not hold many user feature, not to meet assigment deadline anyways.
